    <!--These are paragraphs that lightly describe my trips to other countries but before them
    there is text in heading 2 size stating what country it is. -->
    <h2>Italy</h2>
    <p class="one">My first trip outside of the united states was in Italy to visit some family members
        that I did not even know existed. I could not say no to a free trip, so off I went to Italy.
        When we arrived, I knew who our family was because they had written a post with our names on it and 
        even if our names were not on the poster their handwriting was almost identical to my mothers which
        was small and having to squint in order to read it. The time I spent there was refreshing and I 
        felt like it was a whole different world the air felt cleaner the fruits and vegetables fresher.</p>
         
    <h2>Canada</h2>  
          
    <p class="one">The second country that I had gone to was Canada and there was one major reason why 
        I agreed to this and it was for the pancakes and syrup. I knew that I was being pulled in by the pancakes,
        but I went along with it and I can say that there is no regret in that decision.
        the pancakes were amazing, it could have been that I was hungry and that they were free, but it
        was worth the short trip there.When we were heading back we knew we had forgotten something and 
        that was we did not even go to Niagra Falls so we made a return trip just to get drenched 
        at Niagra Falls.</p>
    
    <h2>Japan</h2>
    
    <p class="one">My next trip was a more than we could handle. I went to Japan with a couple of relatives because 
        it was on their bucket list. We spent more time being lost and it was quite funny watching a 
        woman who spoke Spanish a majority of her life and had little understanding of English try to hold a
        conversation with a Japanese man. I enjoyed the food there because they did not hold back on the 
        vegetables and seasonings.There was one thing that stood out to me and that was the major 
        difference in the culture, such as seeing kids still in school when we visited there and 
        seeing them in uniforms. While we were there it also felt quite crowded and I'm sure if I ever 
        lived in Japan I could never get used to it.</p>
    
    <h2>Australia</h2>
    
    <p class="one">Australia was a scary experience from the beginning the reason was because I had heard all the 
        stories about gigantic spiders and snakes around every corner. We arrived in Perth which was 
        the opposite of what I had expected, it was a regular city. I was told that we probably won't
        see that spiders and snakes in Perth and that we were not going to head outside of the city, 
        I was a bit disappointed that we were not going to see a lot of wilderness but I did get to
        see some kangaroos and koalas.While we were there the food was alright, but I had vegemite
        which was bitter and salty and not to my liking sadly.
        
    <h2>Spain</h2>  
    
   <p class="one">My trip to Spain was also family related. One of my older cousins was now living in Spain
        because got a job offer as an English teacher there. We saw some of the architectures that 
        were known throughout Spain but I was sad because we had missed the running with the bulls
        and the San Fermin festival. We also went to many restaurants and local food shops to eat
        which is the only reason why I agreed to go on the trip.
